# National EMS Quality Alliance  
## Respiratory-01: Respiratory Assessment

This measure also does not have direct evidence to support its validity. However, it is  
known that providers often express discomfort especially with assessment of children and  
that respiratory distress is one of the most common serious conditions encountered by  
EMS providers in pediatric patients. The TEP agreed this measure is clinically important  
and there is value to measuring it. The medical community agrees that, if a pediatric or  
adult patient is experiencing respiratory distress, a respiratory assessment should be  
conducted.  
Performing the respiratory assessment on the patient is the first step to determining if  
additional clinical interventions are necessary, and it is important that this process in care  
be measured. The intent of this measure is to determine if patients experiencing  
respiratory distress are receiving respiratory assessments.  
The denominator, or initial population, for this measure includes EMS encounters for  
patients with a primary or secondary impression of respiratory distress. The measure is  
stratified for patients less or equal to 18 years of age and patients greater than 18 years  
of age to allow continued focus on the pediatric population but also allow for evaluation  
of all patients who should receive respiratory assessment.   
The numerator for the re-specified measure has not changed. While the TEP discussed  
potentially adding additional elements of a respiratory assessment, such as auscultation of  
the lung, it was ultimately decided to limit the numerator to SPO2 and respiratory rate  
measurements, due to feasibility concerns. While there are other elements to a respiratory  
assessment, Respiratory 01 (previously Pediatrics-01) focuses on the completion and  
documentation of these two elements.  
To the experienced EMS Professional, Respiratory-01 (previously Pediatrics-01) appears  
to state the obvious – Every patient should have an assessment of their respiratory status.  
However, documentation of this fundamental element of care is often not completed.  
This may be simply a documentation omission but may also represent an incomplete  
clinical assessment or perhaps because providers are less comfortable assessing children  
than adults. An agency or system can use this measure to identify gaps in standard care  
or documentation of that care and target areas for improvement. This will drive  
recognition for the importance of this measure.
